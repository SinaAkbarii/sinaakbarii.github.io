Hi, you've tumbled upon my page. I am Sina, a PhD candidate in Computer Science at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL). I am advised by [Negar Kiyavash](https://people.epfl.ch/negar.kiyavash?lang=en), chair of [Business Analytics](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/ban/). Previously, I received my double-major BSc. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science in 2019.
